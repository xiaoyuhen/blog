## React-friendly

Griffith is a web video player based on React. For React applications, you can use them directly by import components.

Griffith uses the Context API for state management. For React applications, you can implement custom functionality by import Griffith's Context.

## umd

For non-React applications, or users who are unwilling to install through the npm package, Griffith provides UMD (Universal Module Definition) patterns for JavaScript modules that work everywhere.

## event system

Griffith defines a event system.

For the first frame duration, buffer count and other indicators commonly seen in video players, you can add a log by subscribing to the Griffith event.

For some features that need to communicate with the player, you can interact with the player by subscribing to the Griffith event.

## Streaming

Griffith uses Media Source Extensionsâ„¢ to support streaming of mp4 and m3u8 formats.

- Preloading strategy: Griffith can dynamically control video loading progress through MSE.
- Automatically adjust video quality: Griffith can achieve Automatically adjusted video quality via MSE.
